# Derivative Pricing Models

Welcome to the Derivative Pricing Models repository! This project offers C++ implementations of various asset pricing models used in finance for pricing derivatives such as options. The repository includes code for the following models:

1. **Black-Scholes Model**
2. **Finite Difference Method**
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation Method**

## Overview

Derivative pricing is a critical area in financial engineering and quantitative finance. This repository provides practical implementations of several key pricing models, aimed at helping both practitioners and students understand and apply these techniques.

### Models Included

#### 1. Black-Scholes Model

The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model used for pricing European-style options. It assumes constant volatility and risk-free interest rate, providing a closed-form solution for option pricing.

- **Description:** This implementation calculates the price of European and American call and put options using the Black-Scholes formula. Greeks are also computed.

#### 2. Finite Difference Method

The Finite Difference Method (FDM) is a numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that arise in option pricing models. It is particularly useful for pricing options with complex boundary conditions.

- **Description:** Implements a numerical solution using the Explicit Euler Method.

#### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation Method

Monte Carlo Simulation is a stochastic method used for pricing options by simulating the underlying asset's price paths and averaging the discounted payoff. It is highly flexible and can handle a variety of complex options.

- **Description:** Uses Monte Carlo methods to price call and put options, including calculation on Standard error and deviation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run the code, you'll need a C++ compiler (such as Visual Studios). The code has dependencies on Boost Libraries.
